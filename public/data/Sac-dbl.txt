     SAGUARO ASTRONOMY CLUB DOUBLE STAR DATABASE VERSION 2.1
                  dated Tuesday  25 March 1991

This  compilation  of  data  was  begun in  an  effort  to  provide  a 
comprehensive  observing list for use at the telescope.  This data  is 
released  for private use of anyone who wishes to use  this  database.  
Please do not sell this database in any form.

The  members of the Saguaro Astronomy Club (pronounced sa-war-oh)  of
Phoenix,  Arizona  have provided much of the effort  to  compile  this 
database.  However, it could not have been completed without the skill 
of a variety of people who are not SAC members.  Thank you to all.

Many members of our astronomy club have always enjoyed pretty multiple 
stars and in an effort to provide a large list of these objects,  this 
project  was begun.  We are not foolish enough to believe that  it  is 
complete,  but  it should be a good starting point for even  the  most 
avid amateur double star observer.

We  were lucky enough to receive a copy of the Washington Double  Star 
(WDS)  catalog from Paul Brown in Canada.  We wrote some  programs  to 
glean the best and brightest from that massive list and wound up  with 
the data which you have in this database.  The program was written  to 
get  all  stars  with magnitudes in the WDS that  included  a  primary 
brighter  than 9 and a secondary brighter than 13. If the stars were
closer than 2 arc seconds then the magnitudes had to match within  one
magnitude.  The authors of the SAC double star database think this has 
given us a list which will be useful to owners of modest telescopes.

The  database  is  distributed in ASCII text  files  which  have  been 
compressed  using PKZip to save space.  See the READ-ME.TXT  file  for 
more  details  on  the contents of  the  distribution  diskettes.   We 
divided  the database by RA hour, into five separate files.   Each  of 
the  DBL21? data files has the same layout.  Fields are  separated  by
commas.   Character  fields  are delimited with a  double  quotes.   A 
description of the fields and what data they contain follows:

Details about each field follows:

Field Number: 1      Name: NAME          Size: 8 (Char)
Name of the discoverer of this multiple system.  The problems in
this field are generally going to be with either the Herschel or
Struve family of discoverers.  William Herschel released his binary
star findings is several catagories labeled with Roman numerals based
on how difficult the star is too divide.  This information was not
available to us in the WDS, so you will find several stars labeled
H 40 in the catalog, one would be H II 40, another H IV 40.  This
is an obvious reason that professional double star astronomers refer
to these stars by their ADS or IDS numbers.

Field Number: 6      Name: COMP            Size: 4 (Char)
If this is a multiple system, which components of the triple (or more) 
are  in this record.  For instance, if this field has ABXD  then  this 
field  of  data  applies  to the star system  D  in  relation  to  the 
brightest pair in this multiple star AB.

Field Number: 7      Name: MAG1           Size: 4  (Char)
Magnitude of the primary star.

Field Number: 8      Name: MAG2           Size: 4  (Char)
Magnitude of the secondary star.

Field Number: 9      Name: SEP            Size: 5  (Numeric)
Separation of the pair in arc seconds.

Field Number: 10     Name: PA             Size: 3  (Char)
Position Angle of the pair in arc degrees clockwise from North.

Field Number: 11      Name:  TIRION      Size:  8  (Char)
The charts in the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0 that map the area of sky  in 
which  the star is located.  This is included so that a less  detailed 
view of the area will be available to star hoppers.

Field Number: 12      Name: U2000         Size: 15  (Char)
The charts in the Uranometria 2000.0 that map the area of sky in which 
the  star  is located.  It is not guaranteed that all  multiple  stars 
plotted on U2000 are contained in the database but we are trying. 

Field Number:  13     Name:  SPEC         Size:  3  (Char)
Spectrum of the primary, or the binary pair if a spectroscopic binary.

Field Number:  14     Name:  YEAR         Size:  4  (Char)
Year the measures of this pair were taken.

Field Number:  15     Name:  ADS          Size:  5  (Char)
Number from the Aitken Double Star catalog, a common cross-reference.

Field Number:  16   Name:  NOTES          Size:  54  (Char)
Several abbreviations were used in the Notes section:

cpm  = common proper motion, the pair is moving through The Galaxy  in 
the  same  direction  and  at  the  same  speed.   They  are  probably 
gravitationally bound together.

eclp-bin = eclipsing binary, a system that is edge-on to Earth and the 
stars pass in front of each other, changing the total magnitude.

orbit  calc'd  =  an  orbit  (maybe  a  preliminarily  one)  has  been 
calculated   for   this  system.   Several  references  in   a   large 
astronomical  library will provide a drawing of the orbit.   The  more 
famous pairs are in Burnham's Celestial Handbook.

spect-comp = spectrum composite, the two spectra of the binary form  a 
single spectrum that is the addition of the stars in the multiple star 
system.

sp-bin  =  spectroscopic binary, a pair whose spectra  change  as  the 
motion  of  the system moves through different angles  to  the  Earth.  
Many  very  close binaries are spectroscopic and cannot  be  separated 
visually at the eyepiece.

var = variable, the magnitude of the star changes with time.

HINTS ON USING THE SAC DOUBLE STAR DATABASE

The layout of the data was thought out to try and let the user get the 
type of listing that is preferred with as few problems as possible.

Users  who have taken the time to write or call have said that a  wide 
variety of database managers will make it easier for the sophisticated 
double  star  observer  to utilize the data in  a  variety  of  forms.  
People  have used dBase III, Paradox, PC File, PC File  dB,  Microsoft 
Works, Wampum and a few have used a word processor to search and  sort 
the  SAC database.  It is even possible Import it into Lotus 123 as  a 
Text file.   Several people have considered burning it into a ROM  for 
use in a telescope control program.

Of  course,  if you do not need overly complex  search  routines,  the 
provided SACDBL.EXE program from Dan Ward will suffice.  It allows the 
user to make a fine observing list quickly.  See the REPORTS.DOC  file 
for more details.


                        CONTRIBUTORS

Dan  Ward  did error corrections, fine tuned the data  field  formats, 
wrote  the  install file, edited the documentation and  developed  the 
SACDBL report generator program included with this disk set.  

A.J.   Crayon  did  error  corrections  and  assisted  indirectly   in 
developing the install and observing list program because Dan recycled 
some code that he and A.J. had jointly developed in the past.

Brian  Skiff  provided us with error checking data and  gave  us  much 
input on what to include for each entry.

Steve Stanford wrote the program which determined the Tirion and U2000 
chart numbers.

Steve  Coe co-wrote the file you are reading and checked  and  entered 
data.

Alan Gore parsed out the star names from the Notes as given in the WDS 
and checked and entered data.

John and Tom McGrath checked and entered data.

Kent  Hepburn ran the precession and chart number programs.  He  also
checked and entered data.

Roger Wegehoft of Ashton-Tate provided some dBASE code to strip excess 
blanks  out   of the middle of some data fields, which allowed  us  to 
reduce the overall size of the database by over 500k!  

Wayne  Gary provided valuable suggestions for fine tuning some of  the 
fields formats. 

                       REVISION HISTORY

Version  1.0 was the raw data from the output of a Quick Basic  search 
routine  that  was  written by Bill Anderson and  Steve  Coe  and  run 
against the Washington Double Star catalog as we received it.

Version  1.1  was the output from Alan Gore's dBase III+  program  to
parse the star names from the NOTES.

Version 1.2 contained the precessed values for position and added  the 
chart  numbers.  Steve Stanford wrote the chart numbering program  and 
Kent Hepburn interfaced it with the data from the WDS.

Version 1.3 was a quick check to make certain that we had not lost any 
"famous" doubles while dealing with the above operations.

Version  1.4  was  the output of a  comprehensive  check  that  lasted 
several months trying to catch any errors, large or small, in the data 
or documentation.  All the above versions were internal to the SAC and 
did not get a general release to the public.

Versions 1.5 thru 1.8 were intermediate revisions done by Dan Ward  to  
eliminate  some  data format inconsistencies.  A few  non-SAC  members 
received  copies of one or more of these versions.  When Dan  finished 
1.9, the rest of the team went through it again to make one more check 
prior to release.

Version  2.0 is hereby placed in the public domain.  It is  our  first 
release of the double star database for general use.

Version 2.1 is released to fix a problem that Quick Basic had with
values of Declination near the equator.  The algorithms in QB just don't
understand negative zero!!  A dec such as - 00 32 was forced to become
positive.  So we had to go through all the stars near the equator and
check their declinations.

                         FINAL NOTES

We  realize that such an undertaking could not possibly  be  completed 
without  some  errors or typos creeping into the database.   We  would 
like  you to get in contact with us if you find any of three types  of 
problems.  One, just plain errors, either typos or problems we did not 
know about.  Two, places in the database where we have no data in that 
field and you know what should go there.   Three, ideas on how  better 
to  arrange  the data or programs you have written to  manipulate  the 
data.   It  is  hoped  that over a period of time  we  can  hunt  down 
mistakes  and make the database as error free as possible.  Thank  you 
for any help you can render in attaining that goal.
